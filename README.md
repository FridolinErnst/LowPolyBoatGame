# Pirate Ship Prototype

![Pirate Ships](./fighting%20scene.png)

## âš“ Overview

A **local co-op pirate ship fighting game** being built in **Godot** by me and a friend.  
Players control customizable pirate ships, steering through simulated waves and engaging in chaotic naval battles.  
Each ship can be uniquely built by choosing different **weapons** and **stats**, allowing for creative strategies and playstyles.

Currently in **early prototyping**, featuring:
- Fully **physics-based ship movement**
- **Dynamic water simulation** and **wave effects**
- **Water shader** that affects visuals and buoyancy
- **Keyboard and controller** input support
- **Shooting**, **aiming**, and **movement mechanics**

### ðŸ§­ Ship Physics
Movement and turning are handled through physics forces and torques, resulting in realistic motion and drifting behavior.
